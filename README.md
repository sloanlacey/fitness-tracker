# fitness-tracker

This is a fitness tracker app that allows users to track workout routines and habits.

## Description

This application uses an Express server, MongoDB to store data, and is deployed to Heroku. I built the back end of this project into provided front end code. Users can access previous workout data, add new workout routines and exercises, and log durations and intensity. They can then view their coimpiled data in dashboard graphs.
